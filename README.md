# Developer Notes, warnings and greetings.

Hello ! I'm Carlos, and i'm very happy to be tested for your company. It's my dev notes, to explain how i thinked to make this application.

First thing first, I added all the libs that i have to use, open a Jira board, to make a brainstorm and start a new repo in github, to set my start date.
Second thing is create all the folders, to organize the project, and start coding.

My first note is that i'm using react-router-dom v 5.0.0, to use useHistory instead useNavigation and your friends.
Other thing, is that i opted to use localStorage to store the user data, instead context Api, because i'm more confident to use LocalStorage.
